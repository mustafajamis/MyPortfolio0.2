The ShockShockers dining project, spearheaded by myself, revolutionizes the dining experience into a personalized nutritionist at your fingertips. Amidst the hustle and bustle of student life, making balanced meal choices can be daunting. This innovative solution transcends traditional dining, integrating AI technology seamlessly, presenting its own set of challenges. Under my visionary leadership, the team embarked on a journey to turn it into a culinary virtuoso. Whether you're a dedicated vegan or health-conscious omnivore, ShockShockers dining crafts personalized meal plans tailored to your unique needs. It's not just an application; it's a culinary confidant, a trusted advisor in the pursuit of a balanced diet. Beyond the code, this project is a testament to teamwork, innovation, and my leadership in shaping a healthier, more mindful dining experience for all.

Embarking on a comprehensive exploration of the C++ programming language, I undertook a series of projects that showcase a meticulous understanding of its intricacies. From delving into the mathematical wonders of the Mandelbrot set to crafting a classic Snake game with strong foundations in object-oriented design, each endeavor demonstrated a deep grasp of algorithmic thinking. Leveraging console interfaces and dynamic memory allocation, these projects provided engaging and interactive experiences. Additionally, a foray into game development using Unreal Engine 5 yielded the Obstacle Assault Game, exemplifying an integration of C++ expertise with advanced gaming functionalities. Throughout, I emphasized version control, clear code structure, and rigorous debugging, ensuring optimal functionality and maintainability. These projects collectively stand as a testament to my dedication to mastering C++, blending educational immersion with dynamic programming experiences.
